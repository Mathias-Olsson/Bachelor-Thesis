# Bachelor-Thesis
DTU Bachelor Thesis F20

This repository contains all the code for both MATLAB and OpenViBE used in our Bachelor Thesis.

Aditionally, the CSPFeatures.m function authored by Mathias Sabroe Simonsen is included, 
and so is the computeCSP.m function authored by Ana Palma.
Both these functions have been left in their original state.

Some of the OpenViBE scenarios are based on tutorial scenarios included in our OpenViBE installation
and has been partially modified to suit our needs. The names of all the original scenarios and where
to find them in the OpenViBE installation is mentioned in the Bachelor Thesis.
